// How to create an analog of GridLookUpEdit with TreeList in a popup window
// 
// In some cases, it is useful to display data within LookUpEdit in the
// hierarchical structure. This can be introduced by creating a custom editor –
// TreeListLookUpEdit. This example illustrates how to create such an editor. Here
// we have implemented the following features:
// 
// - The
// RepositoryItemTreeListLookUpEdit.ValueMember and
// RepositoryItemTreeListLookUpEdit.DisplayMember properties. They are intended for
// the same functions as in a regular LookUpEdit/GridLookUpEdit.
// - The
// ProcessNewValue event is implemented like in LookUpEdit/GridLookUpEdit. This
// event is raised when an editor is validated and its display value does not exist
// within an inner TreeList.
// - The property SearchMode allows you to select one of
// the following modes:
// o OnlyInPopup. This mode is an analog of
// IncrementalSearch, but it also expands nodes if it is needed when you type a
// search text. This mode works only if a popup window is shown. o AutoComplete. In
// the Auto Completion mode, the text in the edit box is automatically completed if
// it matches a DisplayMember field value from drop-down nodes.
// o AutoFilter.
// This mode applies a filter to the DisplayMember column. Filter is formed when
// you type a text in the edit box. In addition, it opens a popup window and looks
// for nodes retaining paths to the root to show the context.
// For virtual data
// loading (on demand) in the inner TreeList you can handle its BeforeExpand event.
